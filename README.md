from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
import requests
import json

@csrf_exempt
def DummyFunction(request:requests):
      try:
          #Checking to ensure that the request is the one required for the method to function
          if request.method == #"GET", "POST", "DELETE"
          request_body = json.loads(request.body)	 
      except:
      return JsonResponse({"message":"Failed Post for New Endpoint"}, status = 405)
